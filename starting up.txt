REASONS FOR HAVING A MINIMALIST FREE VERSION PACKAGE

2. Minimal Feature Requirements
Simplicity: Some businesses only need basic functionalities to meet their needs. For example,
            a small company may only require simple task management or basic website analytics, which can be covered by the free version.
Ease of Use: The free version often offers a streamlined, simple interface with fewer features, 
            making it easier for users to get started quickly without needing extensive training or onboarding.

4. Limited Needs at the Moment
Non-Critical Use Cases: Businesses may only require minimal features for non-critical tasks. 
                        For instance, using a free project management tool with limited functionality for basic 
												project tracking or a free email marketing service to send occasional newsletters.
Scalability Considerations: Some businesses start small and use free versions to scale gradually. They might only need
                         basic features at the outset and can upgrade later when their needs grow.

Changes near end

=> detect user timezone and set it in the settings for them
=> Signals are great for background updates but can slow down the request-response cycle, especially for large sales. 
		Consider moving inventory and batch updates to a task queue (e.g., using Django Q or a similar library).
=> Add 'messages' to all the form saveson the frontend.
=> Add 'login_required' to all the views that should be that way.
=> on each page, you can have a descriptive header, saying this page does this and have random quotes about that thing on each reload
	 For eaxmple, on the coupons listing page, I can have the header and quotes about importance of having coupons and down is the list of coupons

=> Maybe the user will get overwhelmed by too many features, so keep them displaying
   but write coming soon on it. And slowly unlock the features. This could alos be
	 used fort he packages distribution.

=> Visual metaphor for the analytics, yes charts are good, but a visual metaphor might just hit hard. can also use that in sales

. use ugly images
. use metaphorical images
. vary your visuals

=> Mention people's doubts in the software, what they might have
=> if I get rejected, ask them why I got rejected and how would you have said yes to the same offer
=> these people let their own reaction to rejection define themselves
